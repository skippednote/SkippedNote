# 🌌 Hello there

I’m Bassam Ismail and I go by `skippednote` across the internet. I work at [Axelerant](https://www.axelerant.com/) where I focus on engineering and product development as a Director of Digital Engineering. In the past, I have been working at [Clipboard Health](https://www.clipboardhealth.com/), [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/), and [Pixoto](https://www.pixoto.com/). These days I like to tinker with stuff around infrastructure and distributed systems.

Away from a computer, I love to travel on my bike, exploring the local food scene, and diving into all kinds of intriguing reading material.
